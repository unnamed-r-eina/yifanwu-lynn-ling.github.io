Hi, my name is **'<span style="color: #9457EB;">Yifan Wu</span>**. I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at Cornell University, where I spend most of my time thinking about how we use and interpret language in real-time. My research interests include psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and semantics/pragmatics. Right now, I am particularly interested in questions revolving around imprecision, scalar inferences, and adaptation. I am also interested in applying computational methods to better understand incremental themes. If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to check out my work in the Publications and Presentations tabs above!

I am a member of the [Linguistic Meaning (LiMe) Lab](https://lime-lab-cornell.github.io/) under [Prof. Helena Aparicio](https://lime-lab-cornell.github.io/HelenaWebsite/index.html) and the [Computational Psycholinguistics Discussion Group (C.Psyd)](https://c-psyd.github.io/) under [Prof. Maten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/).

Recently, I’ve taken up skiing :skier: and crocheting :yarn: as new hobbies!
